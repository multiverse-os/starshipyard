# Views 
Views contains the project level templates, making it easy to define several
templates that can be used throughout the project (like per role, or logged in
or logged out), and organize the various related assets. Starshipyard always
opts for `base64` versions so that everything can be inline. For example, all
images should be stored as base64 in the project database.
